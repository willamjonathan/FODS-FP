<h3><b>Dear reader,</h3>

There are <u>2 folders and 1 file</u> in this page that you can find:<br><br>
1.supervised<br>
2.unsupervised<br>
3.PearsonTest.ipynb
<br>

<h1>Details :</h1><br>
<u>1. The folder named: supervised <br></u> 
Contains the code and evaluation of the supervised machine learning techniques that I used.<br>
<u>2. The folder named: unsupervised <br></u> 
Contains the code and evaluation of the unsupervised machine learning techniques that I used.<br>
<u>3. The file named: PearsonTest.ipynb<br></u>
Contains on code to analyse cluster using Pearson correlation coefficient. <br>
<br>

 
<h1>Additional Notes:</h1>
<br>
The Pearson correlation coefficient is also an inferential statistic, meaning that it can be used to test statistical hypotheses. Specifically, we can test whether there is a significant relationship between two variables.
