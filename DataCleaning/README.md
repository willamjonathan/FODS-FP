<b><h1>DATA CLEANING</h1></b>
<h3><b>Dear reader,</h3>

There are <u>2 folders</u> in this page that you can find:<br><br>
1.DataCleaning<br>
2.mytrialanderrors<br>

<br>

<h1>Details :</h1><br>
<u>1. The folder named: DataCleaning <br><u> 
It contains the code and data that I am going to use to make my Final Project report.<br>
<u>2. The file named: mytrialanderrors <br></u> 
It contains data that I processed alone, however i will not use it as I've gathered data that's more suitable for my project.
